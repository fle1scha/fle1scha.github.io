I'm Antony Fleischer, a South African software engineer and economist. I am about to graduate from the University of Cape Town with a B.SC. (Hons) in Computer Science (major) and Economics (minor). 

It is my ambition to solve developmental socio-economic issues in Africa using fintech, agritech and blockchain. I am also impassioned by sustainability, food, and InfoSec, and have a natural affinity to water. 

If you'd like to get in touch, you'll find me cliff jumping, playing rugby, cooking or at my desk. In all seriousness, if you would like to get in touch, please send me an email or reach out on Twitter. 

Ciao.
